# citations [website](https://anvaka.github.io/citations/)

Find the most cited pages within given categories. Unlike [scholar.google.com](https://scholar.google.com/)
or [www.semanticscholar.org](https://www.semanticscholar.org) we always sort results in decreasing order
of citations.

## Data

Data comes from https://www.semanticscholar.org/ - they do list their own sources and release the entire corpus
with over [39 million published research papers](http://labs.semanticscholar.org/corpus/) for non-commercial use.

I downloaded the corpus, counted every citation, then grouped papers by the keyword, and made this website.

I hope you find it useful in your exploration of knowledge.
